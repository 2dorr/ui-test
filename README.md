# Practical application test

### Data table

The final solution will look and work like this: [live demo](http://raulmatei.com/test)

The solution will be written with JavaScript/HTML/CSS. You have the freedom to work with whatever technology you like *(React/Angular/Ember/etc.)*. We will provide you with a mock JSON which contains all the necessary data to work with. You will find the json file in this **git** repository.

### Specs (which you will also find in the demo)

- the data from the JSON file should be listed in a table like structure.

#### Search & highlight feature

The table can be filtered via a search query string. The application should have an input where the user
can search for any string contained in the table. As the user types (more than 3 chars), every row not containing the typed string will be removed. Also, the typed query will be highlighted on the found string in the table.

#### Table interactions

- each row will have a checkbox associated with it
- the user can select any row from the table when clicking it or by clicking the checkbox associated with that row.
- the user should be able to select all rows by clicking the top checkbox on the first table header
- the user should be able to delete a row by clicking a button
- there should be a counter indicating how may rows are selected


####  Design

Try to maintaing the current design. Or if you can surprise us with something pretier we won't say no :)

#### Things you should have in mind

 - we want to see a well written solution
 - we prefer if you will make a pull request with the final solution
 - it's a plus if you follow an MVC/Flux approach
 - it's a plus if you use a javascript framework
 - it's a plus if you use a CSS preprocessor
 - it's a huge plus if you can add a test suit
 - it's a plus if you use a module system
 - it's a plus if you write your code using ES2015
 - it's a plus if you use some kind of development automatization tool (grunt/gulp/webpack)
